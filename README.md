**🧭 Project Philosophy: The New Artes Liberales**

Welcome to **Learner**.

We believe that true foundational skills for the 21st century are the abilities to **solve problems**, **build solutions**, and **think computationally**. This repository presents a self-guided curriculum designed to cultivate these skills by inextricably linking the abstract world of mathematics with the concrete implementation of programming.

The goal is not just to teach math or Python, but to teach *thinking*—developing a "mason prep" for life's essential skills.

**The Core Idea: Instruments for Exploration**

Mathematics and Python programming are viewed here as essential **instruments**. You must learn to play these instruments proficiently before you can compose complex symphonies in other fields.

Once these foundational tools are mastered, the curriculum is designed to expand into diverse, high-impact domains:

- **Economics (Micro & Macro)**
- **Computational Biology**
- **Physics & Engineering**
- **Data Science & Machine Learning**

**Methodology: Computational Thinking (CT) in Action**

Every module is structured around the core practices of Computational Thinking:

- **Decomposition:** Breaking complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Finding connections between similar problems to leverage previous experience.
- **Abstraction:** Focusing only on essential information and ignoring irrelevant details.
- **Algorithms:** Developing step-by-step solutions before coding.

The focus is on **doing** 
writing code to test hypotheses, visualise relationships, and build functional programs from mathematical rules.

**🎯 Audience & Prerequisites**

This curriculum starts from absolute basics (Pre-Algebra and fundamental Python concepts).

- **Who can learn here?** Anyone. No prior background in math or programming is strictly required. The content is structured for self-directed learners who are ready to put in the effort.
- **The "Firehose" Warning:** If you are new to both subjects, the initial pace might feel intense. This is by design. The goal is rapid, immersive skill acquisition. Persistence is key.
- **Tools Required:**
    - A computer with a working installation of **Python 3.x**.
    - A text editor (like VS Code or Sublime Text).
    - Access to the internet for supplemental research (e.g., the Python Documentation).

**📚 Curriculum Map**

The path is laid out sequentially. We recommend completing modules in the order listed below to build a robust foundation:

| **Module** | **Status** | **Core Topics Covered** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pre-Algebra/** | In Progress | Numbers, Patterns, Sequences, Variables, Basic Operations |
| *Algebra I* | Planned | Equations, Functions, Graphing, Data Visualization |
| *Discrete Math & Logic* | Planned | Sets, Logic Gates, Algorithms, Recursion |
| *Calculus I* | Planned | Rates of Change, Limits, Optimization |
| *Linear Algebra* | Planned | Vectors, Matrices, Data Structures |
| *Applied Domains* | Future | Economics, Biology, Physics, ML (pending core instrument mastery) |

**📁 Repository Structure & How to Use It**

This repository is designed to keep the problem separate from the solution to encourage active learning.

`Learner/
├── README.md               ← (You are here)
└── Pre-algebra/
     ├── README.md          ← Overview of topic/module

         │       └── solution.py    ← ✅ Check your answer here
         └── (more problems...)`

**Your Learning Cycle:**

1. **Read the Module `README.md`:** Understand the theory.
2. **Navigate to a Problem:** Open `problem_prompt.md`. Do not peek ahead!
3. **Solve It:** Open your own blank file outside of this repo and write your Python code.
4. **Test & Compare:** Only once you have a working solution, look inside the `solution/` folder to compare your approach.
5. **Reflect:** Did the problem utilise Decomposition? Abstraction? Make the connection explicit.
